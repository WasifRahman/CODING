**Weekend Project:** Build a number guessing game where the computer selects a random number and the player has to guess it with hints.

## Week 3: Data Structures
**Monday-Tuesday: Lists & Tuples**
- Creating and accessing elements
- List methods (append, insert, remove)
- List comprehensions
- Tuples vs lists (mutability)

**Wednesday-Friday: Dictionaries & Sets**
- Key-value pair operations
- Dictionary methods
- Sets for unique collections
- When to use each data structure

**Weekend Project:** Create a simple contact management system using dictionaries to store name, phone, and email information.

## Week 4: File Operations & Error Handling
**Monday-Tuesday: File I/O**
- Reading and writing text files
- Working with CSV files
- File paths and management

**Wednesday-Friday: Error Handling**
- Try/except blocks
- Common exceptions
- Creating custom exceptions
- Debugging techniques

**Weekend Project:** Build a program that reads a CSV file with student grades, calculates averages, and writes the results to a new file.

## Week 5: Modules & Packages
**Monday-Tuesday: Working with Modules**
- Importing built-in and third-party modules
- Creating your own modules
- Module search paths

**Wednesday-Friday: Essential Libraries**
- datetime for time operations
- random for generating random values
- os and sys for system operations
- json for data interchange

**Weekend Project:** Create a simple task manager that saves tasks to a JSON file and loads them when the program starts.

## Week 6: Object-Oriented Programming
**Monday-Wednesday: OOP Basics**
- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Initialization with `__init__`
- Object interaction

**Thursday-Friday: OOP Advanced**
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Class methods and static methods

**Weekend Project:** Design a simple bank account system with different account types inheriting from a base Account class.

## Week 7: Advanced Features
**Monday-Tuesday: List & Dictionary Comprehensions**
- Advanced comprehensions
- Nested comprehensions
- Generator expressions

**Wednesday-Friday: Functions Advanced**
- Decorators
- Args and kwargs
- Recursive functions
- Closures

**Weekend Project:** Create a data analysis tool that processes a dataset using comprehensions and functional programming techniques.

## Week 8: Practical Applications
**Monday-Tuesday: Working with APIs**
- HTTP requests with requests library
- Parsing JSON responses
- API authentication basics

**Wednesday-Friday: Introduction to Libraries**
- Brief exposure to pandas for data analysis
- Basic plotting with matplotlib
- Simple automation with schedule

**Final Week Project:** Build a weather application that fetches data from a public API and displays forecasts for a user-specified location.

# 5 Projects to Build After Your 8-Week Core Learning

## Project 1: Personal Finance Tracker (Beginner)
**Description:** Create a command-line application that helps track personal expenses and income. Users can add transactions, categorize them, and view summaries.

**Key Concepts:**
- File I/O (reading/writing to CSV or JSON)
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Functions for data manipulation
- Basic data analysis

**Extension Ideas:** Add data visualization using matplotlib, implement budget alerts.

## Project 2: Web Scraper for News Headlines (Intermediate)
**Description:** Build a program that scrapes headlines from news websites, categorizes them, and saves them to a database or file. Include options to search and filter articles.

**Key Concepts:**
- Web scraping with Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
- HTTP requests
- Regular expressions
- Error handling for network issues
- Working with external libraries

**Extension Ideas:** Create a simple web interface using Flask, implement email notifications for specific keywords.

## Project 3: Task Management System with GUI (Intermediate)
**Description:** Create a desktop application for managing tasks with due dates, priorities, and categories. Include features like sorting, filtering, and notifications.

**Key Concepts:**
- GUI programming with Tkinter
- Object-oriented design
- Event-driven programming
- Date/time manipulation
- Data persistence

**Extension Ideas:** Add user authentication, implement cloud synchronization, create mobile companion app.

## Project 4: RESTful API Service (Advanced)
**Description:** Build a RESTful API service using Flask or Django that provides data for a specific domain (e.g., movie database, recipe collection). Include endpoints for CRUD operations.

**Key Concepts:**

## Tips for Success:

1. **Practice daily:** Even 30 minutes of daily coding is better than several hours once a week.

2. **Read code:** Study open-source projects to learn different coding styles and techniques.

3. **Solve challenges:** Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism to practice problem-solving.

4. **Get feedback:** Join Python communities (Reddit's r/learnpython, Discord groups) to share your code and get feedback.

5. **Document your learning:** Keep notes on new concepts and create your own reference materials.

6. **Build from scratch:** Try implementing things yourself before using libraries to deepen your understanding.

Remember, the key to learning programming is building things. Don't worry about mastering every concept before starting projects - the challenges you face while building will be your best teachers!
