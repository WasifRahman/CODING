# Python Patterns: Understanding and Application

## 1. Explanation of Patterns in Python

In Python, "patterns" typically refers to either:

1. **Regular Expression Patterns**: Specialized sequences of characters that define search patterns for text processing.
2. **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common programming problems.
3. **Pattern Matching**: A feature introduced in Python 3.10 that allows structural pattern matching (similar to switch/case in other languages).

For this explanation, I'll focus on **Pattern Matching** since it's a newer Python feature that many are learning about.

**Purpose**: Pattern matching provides a more powerful and expressive way to handle conditional logic when compared to traditional if-elif-else chains, especially when working with complex data structures. It allows you to match values against patterns and extract components from them in a single operation.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Processing structured data (dictionaries, lists, objects)
- Parsing command-line arguments or messages
- State machine implementations
- Data validation and extraction

## 2. Simple Code Example

```python
# Pattern matching example (Python 3.10+)
def analyze_data(data):
    match data:
        case []:
            return "Empty list"
        case [x]:
            return f"List with single element: {x}"
        case [x, y]:
            return f"List with two elements: {x} and {y}"
        case [x, y, *rest]:
            return f"List starts with {x} and {y}, followed by {len(rest)} more elements"
        case {'name': name, 'age': age}:
            return f"Person named {name}, age {age}"
        case {'error': msg}:
            return f"Error occurred: {msg}"
        case _:
            return "Data doesn't match any pattern"

# Examples
print(analyze_data([]))                          # "Empty list"
print(analyze_data([42]))                        # "List with single element: 42"
print(analyze_data([1, 2]))                      # "List with two elements: 1 and 2"
print(analyze_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))             # "List starts with 1 and 2, followed by 3 more elements"
print(analyze_data({'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30})) # "Person named Alice, age 30"
print(analyze_data({'error': 'Not found'}))      # "Error occurred: Not found"
print(analyze_data("hello"))                     # "Data doesn't match any pattern"
```

## 3. Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

1. **Assuming Pattern Matching Works in All Python Versions**
   - **Mistake**: Trying to use pattern matching in Python versions before 3.10.
   - **Solution**: Check your Python version with `import sys; print(sys.version)` and ensure you're using Python 3.10 or newer for pattern matching.

2. **Overlooking Pattern Order**
   - **Mistake**: Placing more general patterns before specific ones, causing specific patterns to never match.
   - **Solution**: Always arrange patterns from most specific to most general, similar to how you would order `except` clauses.

```python
# Wrong order
match value:
    case _:                         # Catches everything
        print("Default case")
    case [1, 2, *rest]:             # Never reached
        print("Starts with 1, 2")

# Correct order
match value:
    case [1, 2, *rest]:             # Specific pattern first
        print("Starts with 1, 2")
    case _:                         # General fallback pattern
        print("Default case")
```

3. **Missing the `case` Keyword**
   - **Mistake**: Using `if` or other keywords instead of `case` inside a `match` block.
   - **Solution**: Remember that pattern matching syntax requires `match` for the overall statement and `case` for each pattern branch.

## 4. Real-World Applications

1. **Command-Line Interface Parsing**
   ```python
   def process_command(command):
       match command.split():
           case ["open", filename]:
               return f"Opening {filename}"
           case ["save", filename]:
               return f"Saving to {filename}"
           case ["search", *terms]:
               return f"Searching for: {' '.join(terms)}"
           case ["exit" | "quit"]:
               return "Exiting program"
           case _:
               return "Unknown command"
   ```

2. **API Response Processing**
   ```python
   def handle_api_response(response):
       match response:
           case {'status': 'success', 'data': data}:
               # Process successful response data
               return f"Processed {len(data)} items"
           case {'status': 'error', 'message': message}:
               # Handle error with message
               return f"Error: {message}"
           case {'status': 'error', 'code': code}:
               # Handle error with code
               return f"Error code: {code}"
           case {'status': status}:
               # Unknown status
               return f"Unknown status: {status}"
           case _:
               # Malformed response
               return "Invalid response format"
   ```

## 5. Progressively Challenging Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Pattern Matching

Write a function `describe_point` that takes a tuple representing a 2D or 3D point and describes it.

```python
def describe_point(point):
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            return "Origin"
        case (0, y):
            return f"On y-axis at y={y}"
        case (x, 0):
            return f"On x-axis at x={x}"
        case (x, y):
            return f"2D point at x={x}, y={y}"
        case (x, y, z):
            return f"3D point at x={x}, y={y}, z={z}"
        case _:
            return "Not a valid point"
```

### Exercise 2: Pattern Matching with Nested Structures

Write a function `parse_event` that parses different event messages.

```python
def parse_event(event):
    match event:
        case {'type': 'click', 'position': (x, y)}:
            return f"Mouse clicked at position ({x}, {y})"
        case {'type': 'keypress', 'key': key}:
            return f"Key pressed: {key}"
        case {'type': 'move', 'from': (x1, y1), 'to': (x2, y2)}:
            distance = ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
            return f"Movement from ({x1}, {y1}) to ({x2}, {y2}), distance: {distance:.2f}"
        case {'type': type_name, **rest}:
            return f"Unknown event type: {type_name} with data: {rest}"
        case _:
            return "Invalid event format"
```

### Exercise 3: Advanced Pattern Matching with Guards

Write a function `categorize_student` that categorizes students based on their grades and additional criteria.

```python
def categorize_student(student):
    match student:
        case {'name': name, 'grades': grades} if all(g >= 90 for g in grades):
            return f"{name} is an excellent student with all A grades"
        case {'name': name, 'grades': grades} if any(g < 60 for g in grades):
            failing = sum(1 for g in grades if g < 60)
            return f"{name} is at risk with {failing} failing grades"
        case {'name': name, 'grades': grades} if sum(grades)/len(grades) >= 80:
            return f"{name} is above average with a B average"
        case {'name': name, 'grades': grades}:
            return f"{name} has average performance"
        case {'name': name}:
            return f"{name} has no grade data"
        case _:
            return "Invalid student record"
```

## Thought-Provoking Question

If pattern matching is primarily a syntactic feature for making code more readable and maintainable, how might you design a complex data processing pipeline that leverages pattern matching to handle different data formats and edge cases elegantly? Consider how this approach might compare to traditional object-oriented or functional programming approaches in terms of maintainability and extensibility.# Python Patterns: Understanding and Application
